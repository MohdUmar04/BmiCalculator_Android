## Project Overview

The BMI Calculator is an Android application designed to help users monitor their fitness by calculating their Body Mass Index (BMI). It's built using Java as the backend language, ensuring a robust and reliable performance. The frontend is designed using XML, providing a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

## Features
